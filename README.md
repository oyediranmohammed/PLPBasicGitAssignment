I followed the instructions on the PLP LMS. 

I encountered several challenges but what I did differently was to create a pull request.

The steps are as follows:

1. I created the repository on my github account with the README.md file 

2. I came to my local computer to create the folder with the same name as the repository on github.

3. I opened the git bash on my pc directly from the folder which i created in step 2.

4. I initialize the folder using the command <git init> from gitbash. 

5. I linked the created folder with my remote repo using the command <git remote add origin git@github.com:oyediranmohammed/PLPBasicGitAssignment.git>.

6. I created a pull request using the command <git pull origin master> so that the remote folder and the local folder can synchronise.

7. I created the file hello.txt using the command <touch hello.txt>. 

8. I added the text "Hello, Git!" inside the hello.txt file using the command {echo "Hello,Git!" >>hello.txt}. 

9. I added the file hello.txt using the command <git add hello.txt>. 

10. I commit the changes using the command <git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greeting">. 

11. I pushed the committed changes to my online repository using the command <git push -u origin master>.
